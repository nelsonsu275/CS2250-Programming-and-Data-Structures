Project 1: Array Manipulation and Pointers

Part 1:
Program prompts user for the size of the array to initialize (1-52).
After the array is initialized, it is displayed to the screen.
The shuffled version of the array is displayed after.

Part 2:
Two subarrays are dynamically created.
Odd integers are stored in the oddArray.
Even integers are stored in the evenArray.

Part 3:
An array fight is simulated where two arrays are taken.
The odd and even array are compared by each matching index.
The highest integer of each index will go into the resulting array.

Part 4:
The resulting array of the array fight will be sorted and displayed to screen.
